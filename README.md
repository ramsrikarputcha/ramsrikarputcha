## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! I'm Ram Srikar Putcha. A passionate software developer interested in building efficient and scalable web applications.  
I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Information Systems from Northeastern University and have a strong foundation in full-stack development. 
I'm proficient in various programming languages (Check out my recume and website) and eager to learn new technologies.

I enjoy collaborating with teams to solve complex problems and deliver high-quality solutions. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends or honing my skills in competitive programming. 

Let's connect and build something awesome together!
